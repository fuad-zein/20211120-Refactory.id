# Skill Test with Refactory.id

This project to test my ability.

## Hello, My Name is Fuad Zein

In this project I divided into four branches on this GitHub repository, with the following details:

### `Master`

Provide information on the results of the work and how to run the program on each branch.

### `Part-1_Test_Logic`

Logic tests are carried out using the JavaScript language and can be run simply by `node nameFile`.

### `Part-2_JSON_Manipulation`

With this JSON manipulation, we have to process the data.json and call the data ordered in this task. You can call functions in JavaScript with the `node nameFile` command.

### `Part-3_Mini_App`

A mini-apps project which is based on the React JS framework. You can open it in a browser by entering the address [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can run in the terminal with:

- `cd mini-app`: to enter its directory.
- `npm install`: to install the dependencies.
- `npm start`: to run the program.
